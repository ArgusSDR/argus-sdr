Write a plan for this, and write all of it to PLAN.md.

1. REST API
2. Has authetication using email addresses and passwords
3. Written in Golang
4. Uses LetsEncrypt for SSL certificates
5. Once authenticated type 1 clients register
6. Once type 1 clients are registered a websocket is held open to allow the server to request data from them.
7. The authentication information is stored in  a SQLite database
8. Type 2 clients also authenticate
9. Type 2 clients request data from the API, and the API calculates that data from the Type 1 clients.
10. The minimium number of Type 1 clients is 3
11. If there are more than 3 Type 1 clients then pick 3 of them randomly


Use PLAN.md as a guide, make your own tasks based on it, and start writing the application.
