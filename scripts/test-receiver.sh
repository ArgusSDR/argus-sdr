echo "✓ Uses command line arguments with cobra instead of interactive prompts"
echo "✓ Only implements the 'request' command (no status/list)"
echo "✓ Has no request types - there's only one data collection type"
echo "✓ Automatically downloads files when ready"
echo "✓ Follows the flow: receiver -> API -> websocket to collector -> collector runs docker -> collector notifies API -> API notifies receiver -> receiver downloads"
